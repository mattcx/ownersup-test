                        Owners Up provides two things that entrepreneurs need most: Community and Accountability. The intimate group makes it so that you never have to worry about having your questions answered and you also have nowhere to hide if you don't accomplish your goal.
                        Owners Up motivates you to take charge of your business and helps you meet others who are as passionate as you are. It also gives you that needed extra look from people outside your community. No one will yes you to death and everyone
                        is honest. It's a program that will help you grow your business faster and more efficiently than any "networking" group"

                    <p>
                        One of my biggest problems with being a solo entrepreneur is that I have nobody Im accountable to. Which means no deadlines, no problems if things dont get done. It's very easy to slip into cruise mode. My day usually consists of reacting to problems
                        rather than moving the company forward. With Owners UP I love being able to get advice from the group, helping others and creating and focusing on my goals. The program forces me to get something done every day. My productivity
                        has increased on a daily basis, Im actually thinking about how to move the business forward and what I've done with my time."

                        It's so easy to give advice to someone else, but many times the most obvious solution for my business is impossible for me to see because I'm too close to it. Ownersup completely solves that problem.”

                    <p>
                        It’s amazing how clarifying it can be when you can bounce ideas off a few other people who are also playing on the same field. Getting feedback every single week from people who understand your goals, strengths and weaknesses is invaluable. I had a hard
                        time trying to figure out what to focus on before and growth was sporadic, slow and unsustainable. But now it’s starting to feel like a fast-paced, highly strategic game.”
