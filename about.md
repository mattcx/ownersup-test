> Everyone should have a success team.

Being an entrepreneur is tough. 90% of companies fail in the first five years. Founders are often overwhelmed and don’t focus on the right things.

That’s why we started OwnersUp. It’s a place where entrepreneurs come together to help each other achieve their goals in a supportive community.

Cofounders Tanya and Matt knew they couldn’t do it alone. They joined forces to create a platform to give entrepreneurs goal-setting tools and accountability groups.

OwnersUp gives you:
* Software to track goals and progress
* Weekly video calls to give you a sounding board
* A coach that keeps you accountable and helps you grow your company
* Membership in a small group that really knows you and your business

## Tanya’s Story

I started my first company at 25 and grew it to over $1 million in revenue in the first year. Since then, I have founded, bootstrapped, sold and invested in five companies. In my spare time I’m a runner, and I wondered why, as an entrepreneur, I didn’t have a coach to course-correct my stride and daily touch points to help me feel like I was a part of a bigger community. I wanted to start a company where people could have a team on their side to achieve their dreams.

Our goal is to give every entrepreneur a team, no matter where they’re located.
