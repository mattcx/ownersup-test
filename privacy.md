Your privacy is critically important to us. At OwnersUp we have a few fundamental principles:

*   We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
*   We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
*   We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our [support team](mailto:support@ownersup.com).

OwnersUp LLC. (“**OwnersUp**”) operates the website [dashboard.ownersup.com](http://dashboard.ownersup.com/). It is OwnersUp’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, OwnersUp collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OwnersUp's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OwnersUp's visitors use its website. From time to time, OwnersUp may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

OwnersUp also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. OwnersUp only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

As a visitor applies to and becomes a member of OwnersUp, we need to gather personally-identifying information. This information includes their email, name, the name of their company. OwnersUp collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with OwnersUp. OwnersUp does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

OwnersUp may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, OwnersUp may aggregate the percentage of users who have reached their monthly financial goal while using our service. OwnersUp may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, OwnersUp does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

OwnersUp discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on OwnersUp’s behalf or to provide services available at OwnersUp’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using OwnersUp’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. OwnersUp will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, OwnersUp discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when OwnersUp believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of OwnersUp, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of  OwnersUp and have supplied your email address, OwnersUp may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with OwnersUp and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. OwnersUp takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. OwnersUp uses cookies to help OwnersUp identify and track visitors, their usage of OwnersUp website, and their website access preferences. OwnersUp visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OwnersUp’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of OwnersUp’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If OwnersUp, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that OwnersUp goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of OwnersUp may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, OwnersUp may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in OwnersUp’s sole discretion. OwnersUp encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
